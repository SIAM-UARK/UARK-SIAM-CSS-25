Group 1:,Maurice,Fabien,mfabien@mit.edu,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Schwarzman College of Computing",Contributed Talk,Robust multilevel preconditions for Darcy and Brinkman models of flows in highly heterogeneous porous media,"
    Common models for heterogeneous flow in porous media (hydrology applications, industrial and environmental processes), such as the Darcy equation or Brinkman equation, are partial differential equations (PDEs) which can have highly varying nonlinear jump coefficients. For accurate approximations, this requires a careful choice of numerical discretization. In this talk, I will present standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations to approximate the Darcy and Brinkman equations. The DG discretization gives rise to a large sparse linear system of equations which has to be resolved. The conditioning of the linear system is very poor due to the highly varying jump coefficients and the higher-order nature of the DG method.
          
    Multilevel techniques (e.g., multigrid, domain decomposition) are well known to be among the most efficient linear solvers for the discretizations that arise from elliptic PDEs. Many multilevel preconditioners assume that there is a meaningful geometric mesh hierarchy available, which is not the case in many applications (e.g., direct flow simulation using high-resolution micro-computed tomographic ($\mu$-CT) images of porous rock). Straightforward application of preexisting multilevel solvers to non-conforming, totally discontinuous discretizations tend to result in methods that do no scale. This is especially noticeable in the presence of highly varying jump coefficients on unstructured meshes, and for positive semidefinite linear systems.
          
    A novel multilevel preconditioned Krylov subspace is introduced. The preconditioner is provably optimal in the sense that the condition number remains bounded independent of the contrast in material parameters, as well as the mesh size. In other words, the total iteration count from the preconditioned Krylov subspace method remains fixed regardless of the mesh size and highly varying jump coefficients. Several examples will demonstrate the robustness of the preconditioner. Some noteworthy features of the preconditioner are: the highly heterogeneous permeability does not need to be aligned with the mesh, the heterogeneous permeability can be anisotropic, and no geometric hierarchy is required for the computational domain.

These models pose challenges due to degeneracies in the noise, despite satisfying Hörmander’s condition. We will discuss our main result, which establishes quantitative minorization for these processes by deriving uniform lower bounds on their transition densities. This is joint work with David Herzog and Kyle Liss.

,Nhung,Nguyen,nhungnh@ksu.edu,Kansas State University,Contributed Talk,Inverse scattering from nonlinear objects in 2D acoustic waveguides,"This talk addresses the inverse scattering problem for the nonlinear Helmholtz equation of Kerr type in 2D waveguides. The goal is to reconstruct the shape and location of nonlinear scattering objects in the waveguide from boundary scattered field data. This problem has important applications in physics and engineering, including radar, sonar, optics, and nondestructive testing. We first prove the uniqueness of the solution to the inverse problem using the factorization method under the assumption of small incident waves. Based on this theoretical framework, we propose an imaging function to numerically recover the location and shape of the unknown object. The method is fast, stable, and notably achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to the direct sampling method. This is based on joint work with Dinh-Liem Nguyen and Thi-Phong Nguyen."
,B,Sagar,b.sagar@ucf.edu,University of Central Florida,Contributed Talk,Numerical simulation of fractional Schamel–KdV equation for ion-acoustic solitary waves in dusty plasma,"The Schamel–KdV equation plays a vital role in studying the effect of electron trapping on the nonlinear interaction of ion-acoustic waves in plasma and dusty plasma. This work presents a numerical scheme-based radial basis function-finite difference (RBF-FD) method to solve the time-fractional Schamel–KdV equation. In the discretization process, a finite difference technique is used to discretize the temporal derivative, while the multiquadric RBF is used to approximate the spatial derivatives. The theoretical convergence and stability analysis of the time-discrete scheme are also established. In addition, numerical experiments are executed through some illustrated problems, and the obtained results are compared with that acquired by the tanh method and Kudryashov method solutions to show the high accuracy and plausibility of the proposed technique. Also, the graphical representations are given to demonstrate the physical interpretation of the resulting wave structures."

Group 2:,Yingli,Li,yingli.li@colostate.edu,Colorado State University,Contributed Talk,Fast and Positive fPINNs for Time-Fractional Convection-Diffusion Equations via MFL1 Schemes,"Fractional partial differential equations (fPDEs) are powerful tools for modeling anomalous transport and memory-dependent processes, but their numerical solution remains challenging due to the nonlocal nature of fractional operators. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a mesh-free alternative for solving PDEs, their fractional counterparts (fPINNs) face critical limitations: (1) high computational cost in evaluating fractional derivatives, (2) loss of solution positivity, and (3) poor generalization across different equations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates the modified fast L1 (MFL1) algorithm into fPINNs, enabling efficient and robust computation of Caputo fractional derivatives.
Our approach leverages sum-of-exponentials (SOE) approximation to reduce the computational complexity, while preserving solution non-negativity—an essential property for physical consistency. Furthermore, we
introduce a Sobolev-norm loss function to enhance solution smoothness and optimization stability."
,Shumaila,Ambreen,shumaila@ksu.edu,Kansas State University,Contributed Talk,Reconstruction of periodic structures in inverse elastic scattering,"This study addresses the inverse elastic scattering problem for
penetrable periodic structures. We investigate a sampling-type algorithm that
utilizes a novel imaging function to numerically reconstruct the periodic scat-
terer from boundary measurements of scattered waves. This research is driven
by applications in the nondestructive evaluation of periodic structures, particu-
larly in optics. We discuss the resolution and stability of the proposed imaging
function, highlighting its performance. Additionally, several numerical exam-
ples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm."
,Hugo,Rodriguez,hugorod@okstate.edu,Oklahoma State University,Contributed Talk,Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Data Augmentation in Metal Additive Manufacturing,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly applied in Additive Manufacturing (AM) for anomaly detection and in-situ monitoring. However, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models typically require copious amounts of data to achieve high accuracy. In Metal AM, data collection is costly and time consuming, making it difficult to obtain sufficiently large datasets to train ML and DL models for quality control purposes. To address this limitation, data augmentation techniques are implemented to enhance model performance. Generative Models (GMs) are particularly promising, given their capacity to generating high quality and realistic synthetic samples that expand training datasets. Nevertheless, these models still demand substantial data to be trained. To overcome this challenge, it is proposed to incorporate domain specific knowledge into the training process by introducing physics-informed terms into the loss function of a Deinosing Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). This guides the model to learn specific process characteristics more efficiently, and to generate more realistic synthetic data that resembles the original training dataset. The resulting augmented datasets can improve the ML or DL models for anomaly detection or in-situ monitoring tasks in AM."
,Ziren,Chen,zc2m@iastate.edu,Iowa State University,Contributed Talk,Inf-Sup Neural Networks for Solving High-Dimensional PDE Problems,"Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a fundamental challenge in numerical mathematics. In this research work, we propose a novel neural network-based approach that reformulates the PDE as an inf-sup optimization problem using a Lagrange multiplier. The solution to the PDE and the Lagrange multiplier are parameterized by a primal network and an adversarial network, respectively, and are iteratively updated to approximate the optimal parameters. We establish the theoretical equivalence between the proposed optimization framework and the original PDE, providing rigorous error bounds to quantify the approximation accuracy. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating its accuracy and stability in solving high-dimensional PDEs."

Group 3:,William,Barker,wkbarker@ualr.edu,UNiversity of Arkansas at Little Rock,Contributed Talk,Traveling Waves for a Diffusive SIR Epidemic model with Delay in the Diffusion Term ,"We discuss the existence of traveling waves in a diffusive SIR model with delay incorporated in the diffusion terms and a nonlinear incidence rate with delay. By employing a cross-iteration scheme and partial monotonicity conditions, we establish that the existence of quasi-upper and lower solutions, along with suitable super and sub-solutions, provides sufficient conditions for the existence of a traveling wavefront. This existence result is obtained via Schauder’s fixed-point theorem. Furthermore, given an appropriate basic reproduction number, the traveling wavefront transitions from the disease-free steady state to the endemic steady state. To illustrate our approach, we explicitly construct super- and sub-solutions for a specific model. "
,Ling ,He,lhe2@memphis.edu,University of Memphis,Contributed Talk,Decay Rates of Energy in Overdamped and Underdamped Second Order Evolutions-Application to Nonlinear Wave and Plates,"A central question in stability theory is whether solutions of differential equations converge to equilibrium, and at what rate. For linear systems, Borichev and Tomilov (2010) gave sharp decay rates via resolvent estimates, but this approach does not extend to nonlinear semigroups in infinite-dimensional spaces.
We study hyperbolic-like dynamics, where essential spectrum on the imaginary axis makes stability dependent on damping. Our framework covers broad classes of second-order abstract evolution models on Banach spaces, including nonlinear wave, plate, and shell equations with various nonlinear damping types, such as over- and underdamping.

Classical resolvent and Lyapunov methods have limited applicability in this level of generality. To overcome these challenges, we develop a new methodology based on reducing the asymptotic behavior of the nonlinear infinite-dimensional system to that of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation, achieved through a careful energy reconstruction process (with connections to inverse problems). This approach is inspired in part by the work of Lasiecka and Tataru on uniform boundary stabilization for semilinear wave equations (Differential and Integral Equations, 1993). Our results not only extend the theory to much broader classes of dynamical systems, but when applied to specific models from the literature, they yield stronger conclusions than previously known. In this talk, I will present our findings on energy decay rates under certain damping assumptions and highlight the energy reconstruction method that forms the foundation of our analysis."
,Andrew,Becklin,andrew.becklin@drake.edu,Drake University,Contributed Talk,Global Well-Posedness of a Structural Acoustic Model with arbitrary source term on plate and no damping,"In this talk, we consider a structural acoustic model consisting of a wave equation defined in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ R3, strongly coupled with a Berger plate equation acting on the flat portion of the boundary of Ω. The system is influenced by an arbitrary C1 source term in the plate equation. Using nonlinear semigroup theory and monotone operator theory, we establish the existence of local solutions. Furthermore, we show that these solutions are unique and depend continuously on the initial data, and we provide a criterion for global existence. With additional assumptions on the source term h, we examine the Nehari manifold and establish the global existence of potential well solutions. Our aim is to investigate the scenarios under which the system is globally well-posed when the source term has arbitrary growth and no damping terms are present to stabilize the system."
,Shengzhe,Zhou,shzhou@okstate.edu,Oklahoma State University,Contributed Talk,Spatio-temporal thermal history modeling and characterization for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing processes,"Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is a large-area directed energy deposition process that joins wire feedstock using an electric arc. The broader deployment of WAAM in mission-critical settings is constrained by the high process uncertainty, leading to compromised geometric accuracy and mechanical properties of the manufacturing parts. The thermal history of WAAM is a key predictor of final geometry, yet its spatio-temporal evolution is highly dynamic and difficult to characterize in real time. We present a U-Net–based spatio-temporal modeling framework that learns directly from infrared thermal image sequences to predict near-future thermal behavior, and thus characterizes the evolution of layer-wise thermal history. By leveraging an encoder–decoder with skipped connections to fuse multi-scale spatial context while preserving fine-scale details, the proposed approach uses most recently observed thermal frames as inputs and predicts multiple future frames. The case study uses a CMT welding torch and an ABB robotic arm, where the learned model captures thermal dynamics and enables short-horizon prediction, which could enable predictive process control.

Group 4:,Yangfan,Cui,ycui25@ncsu.edu,North Carolina State University,Contributed Talk,The Kaplan-Meier UCB Bandit Algorithm for Patient Assignment in Long-Term Clinical Trials,"Randomized controlled trials are the norm for determining treatment effectiveness in clinical research. However, an ethical dilemma arises when statistical power requires assigning patients to treatments that may be sub-optimal for their well being. One solution to this problem is to utilize a multi-armed bandit algorithm for patient assignment, designed specifically to balance the need for exploration to achieve statistical power against exploitation of the best treatment to serve patients' interests. In this paper, we propose the so-called Kaplan-Meier Upper Confidence Bound (KM-UCB) algorithm, a version of the standard UCB algorithm that we tailor to clinical trials where long-term patient survival is the goal. The KM-UCB provides theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of survival functions, and also has sublinear regret. In simulation, the KM-UCB consistently leads to an exploration/exploitation balance that produces estimated survival functions with less variance than those from greedy algorithms. Our empirical analyses include a bootstrapped simulation of data from a recent study on breast cancer treatments, which demonstrate the potential efficacy of KM-UCB in real-world clinical trials."
,Barsha,Saha,bsfmt@umkc.edu,University of Missouri-Kansas City,Contributed Talk,Analyzing Zoonotic Spillover Risk Under Extreme Weather Events Using a Deterministic and Stochastic Lotka-Volterra Modeling Approach,"Extreme weather events—both acute and chronic—can fundamentally reshape ecological dynamics by altering species interactions, promoting competitive imbalances, and increasing the risk of extinction or dominance. Recent studies show increased urban rodent populations in the U.S., driven by warming and urbanization, raising public health concerns due to their role as reservoirs in zoonotic transmission. To investigate how climate disturbances influence reservoir dominance and spillover risk, we develop a stochastic Competitive Lotka–Volterra (CLV) model.  Our system is parameterized to exhibit Zeeman’s Class 27 dynamics, which support heteroclinic coexistence through multiple limit cycles. The model incorporates white noise (seasonal fluctuations), and Lévy jumps (extreme shocks) to capture climate-induced variability. We establish the existence, positivity, and boundedness of global solutions and derive sufficient conditions for species persistence and extinction under both noises. Numerical simulations reveal how varying noise and jump intensities drive transitions between coexistence, dominance, and collapse. We further integrate a spatial spillover framework to quantify pathogen exposure under shifting ecological regimes. This study links ecological stability with public health risk, offering insights into the impact of climate-driven disturbances on zoonotic emergence."
,Hang,Yi,hang.yi@okstate.edu,Oklahoma State University,Contributed Talk,Impact of Gas Carrier on Inhaled Medicinal Aerosolized Particles Transport and Deposition in a Human Respiratory System: A CFPD Study,"Due to its rapid onset of action and lower systemic doses, inhalation therapy plays a crucial role in the treatment of respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis, as well as in the increasingly widespread use of systemic drug delivery for non-pulmonary conditions. To increase the delivered dose of inhaled medicinal aerosolized particles reaching designated lung sites (e.g., small airways), historical focuses were on optimizing drug particle properties and revising inhaler designs. In contrast, the composition of gas carriers, which can significantly impact inhaled particle trajectories, has often been treated as a fixed or secondary parameter. Recent clinical studies have revealed that inhaling an H₂/O₂ gas mixture may have positive effects in treating lung diseases, including COPD, by providing biological anti-inflammatory benefits. However, the influence of a H₂/O₂ gas mixture on inhaled particle transport and deposition to designated lung sites under various particle sizes and breathing patterns remains understudied. 
To address such a knowledge gap and enhance fundamental understanding on how gas carrier can potentially enhance the targeted drug delivery to small airways for better therapeutic outcome, this study simulated and compared the differences between air and H₂/O₂ (a volumetric ratio of 2:1) mixed gas carriers in inhaled medicinal aerosolized particles transport and deposition in a representative human respiratory system covering from mouth to generation 9 (G9) using an experimentally validated Euler-Lagrange based computational fluid particle dynamics (CFPD) model. Multiple particle diameters (i.e., 1, 5, and 10 μm) and breathing frequencies (i.e.,12, 16, and 20 times/min) were simulated, respectively. Specifically, for all simulations, a fixed tidal volume of 500 mL was employed. The time duration ratio between inhalation and exhalation was set as 1:2, and three breathing cycles were simulated.  Particles were released into the mouth inlet at the beginning of the third cycle, and a total of 100,000 particles were released four times with a time interval of 0.01 s. 
Simulation results revealed that compared with air, the H₂/O₂ gas mixture can deliver more particles to the peripheral lung region (>G9) with all particle sizes and breathing patterns investigated in this study. The improved delivered dose to the>G9 region with the H₂/O₂ mixture is attributed to its lower density and higher kinematic viscosity compared with air, which reduces the Reynolds number and consequently lowers airflow resistance and turbulence in the respiratory tract. This reduction in inertial impact and turbulence dispersion results in fewer ineffective depositions in upper airways and more particle penetration into the peripheral lung (>G9). Under optimal conditions (i.e., 1 μm particles and 12 inhalation-exhalation cycles per min), peripheral deposition reached 99.09% for the H₂/O₂ mixture and 98.96% for air, whereas the lowest values (4.86% for H2/O2 and1.1% for air, respectively) occurred with 10 μm particles and 12 inhalation-exhalation cycles per min. Therefore, using an H₂/O₂ mixture as the carrier gas has the potential to enhance peripheral lung deposition compared with air. 
Furthermore, increasing particle size or breathing frequency, either individually or in combination, results in higher particle deposition in the mouth-to-G9 region due to the enhanced inertial impaction and turbulence dispersion effects. This finding suggests that smaller particles, combined with lower breathing frequencies, may improve drug delivery efficiency to the peripheral lung (>G9), thereby enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness of inhalation therapies for treating small-airway diseases.

,Kiel ,Corkran,kcbch@umsystem.edu,University of Kansas City Missouri ,Contributed Talk,Bayesian Inference of MRSA Transmission from 2024 EHR Data in Drug-Using and Non–Drug-Using Patient Populations,"We used Bayesian compartmental modeling to quantify healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) transmission among drug-using and drug-free patient populations in a Midwestern safety-net hospital over 2024. From 18,192 electronic health records (7,076 drug-using; 11,116 drug-free), we estimated transmission, isolation, and discharge rates across multiple nursing unit types using the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) MCMC algorithm. Most nursing units showed higher mean transmission rates for drug-using patients, with differences up to 0.034, particularly in Progressive Care Units and Surgical ICUs. Only specialized units such as the Cardiac Care Center had higher rates in drug-free patients. These findings highlight structural vulnerabilities in high-acuity units serving drug-using populations and demonstrate the power of Bayesian modeling to guide targeted infection control interventions in safety-net hospital settings."

Group 5:,Robert,Ireri,ireri@ksu.edu,Kansas State University,Contributed Talk,A Numerical Method for Coefficient Reconstruction of a Periodic Inverse Source Problem.,"This research focuses on reconstructing a periodic array of sources from measurements of waves emitted from those sources. This array can have infinitely many sources along one direction in space, thus is unbounded. A practical application of this problem is in Non-Destructive Testing, where the goal is to assess integrity of the sources without causing them any damage. To solve this problem, we employ the Quasi-Reversibility Method (QRM) which has been successfully applied to inverse source problems in the bounded setting. Both theoretical and numerical studies are investigated. In this talk, I will present the results for the numerical experiments which demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method under various noise levels and different source configurations, including elliptical, sinusoidal, and bar-shaped sources. This is joint work with Trung Truong.

,Yan-Han,Chen,yanhanc@iastate.edu,Iowa State University,Contributed Talk,NEURAL SOLVER FOR WASSERSTEIN GEODESICS AND OPTIMAL TRANSPORT DYNAMICS,"We propose a sample-based learning framework for computing the Wasserstein geodesic between a source and target distribution, along with the associated velocity field. Building on  the dynamical formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, we recast the constrained optimization as a minimax problem, using deep neural networks to approximate the relevant functions. This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both synthetic and realistic datasets."
,Idowu,Ijaodoro,ieijaodoro@crimson.ua.edu,"The Univeersity of Alabama, Tuscaloosa",Contributed Talk,On generalizing the induced surface charge method to heterogeneous Poisson-Boltzmann models for electrostatic free energy calculation,"The induced surface charges (ISC) method, which computes the induced charges on the molecular surface of macromolecules and uses them via Coulomb's law to calculate the polar solvation energy, was shown to be a robust and almost grid independent approach for electrostatic analysis based on the sharp-interface Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) model. 
Besides being physically intuitive, the ISC method avoids using the potential near the point charges, which is singular at each atom center. However, the ISC method cannot be physically generalized to heterogeneous dielectric PB models, due to the non-existence of a dielectric boundary. 
In this work, a novel far-field (FF) method is proposed to calculate the polar solvation free energy, which is derived through reformulating the energy functionals of nonlinear PB potential in solvent and vacuum states. 
Built upon a rigorous mathematical analysis, the FF method reconstructs the free energies by using far-field solutions outside the solute so that the self-energy terms generated by the singular charges are avoided, just as in the ISC method. 
Being valid for both sharp-interface and heterogeneous PB models, the performance of the proposed FF method has been validated by considering diffuse interface, Gaussian and super-Gaussian PB models for Kirkwood spheres and various protein systems. Comparison with  grid-energy cancellation  and regularization methods is also considered. 
The robustness of the FF method in treating a non-rigid biomolecule with different molecular structures in solvent and vacuum states has been explored, taking advantage of the fact that the far-field potential is insensitive to perturbations of singular charge locations."
,Lin,Feng,zero3829@iastate.edu,Iowa State University,Contributed Talk,A Generalized Energy-Based Adaptive Gradient Method for Optimization,"Adaptive Gradient Descent with Energy (AEGD), introduced in \cite{liu_aegd_2025},   is a variant of Gradient Descent (GD) designed to address step size sensitivity. AEGD is distinguished by its unconditional energy stability -- ensuring convergence in energy regardless of the initial step size.
   
In this work, we propose a Generalized Energy-Based Adaptive Gradient (gAEGD) method, which  extends AEGD by replacing the square root energy function with a broader class of energy functions. We show that gAEGD preserves energy stability property, is robust to step size selection, and exhibits a two-phase adaptive dynamic: the effective step size initially adjusts dynamically and subsequently stabilizes within a range that guarantees the decay of the function values. We establish an optimal convergence rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ for the stationary gap $\|\nabla f(x_k)\|^2$ at iteration $k$, along with refined convergence rates of the objective gap under a local Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz (KL) condition. Empirical results support our theoretical
findings and further show  that a specific instance -- ALEGD, based on a logarithmic energy function -- often outperforms AEGD across a range of optimization tasks."

Group 6:,Sudan ,Xing,sxing@ualr.edu,University of Arkansas at Little Rock,Contributed Talk,New fiber and graph combinations of convex bodies,"Three new combinations of convex bodies are introduced and studied: the $L_p$ fiber,  $L_p$ chord and  graph combinations. These combinations are defined in terms of the fibers and graphs of pairs of convex bodies, and each operation generalizes the classical Steiner symmetral, albeit in different ways. For the $L_p$ fiber and $L_p$ chord combinations, we derive Brunn--Minkowski-type inequalities and the corresponding Minkowski's first inequalities. We also prove that the general affine surface areas are concave (respectively, convex) with respect to the graph sum, thereby generalizing fundamental results of Ye ({\it Indiana Univ. Math. J.}, 2014) on the monotonicity of the general affine surfaces under Steiner symmetrization. As an application, we  deduce a corresponding Minkowski's first inequality for the $L_p$ affine surface area of a graph combination of convex bodies. This is a joint work with Dr. Steven Hoehner."
,Hannah,Havel,z1965113@students.niu.edu,Northern Illinois University (Department of Computer Science),Contributed Talk,Analysis of Central Configurations in the Unequal Mass 4-Body Problem,"The classification of central configurations plays a central role in the qualitative study of the Newtonian N-body problem, governing the relative equilibria and motions of gravitational systems. We present new study for the planar 4-body problem with three equal masses and one unequal mass. This mass distribution is a natural next step beyond the equal-mass case.

We describe a systematic approach to identifying and categorizing central configurations as a function of the mass parameter 𝜇, combining numerical and computational methods. Particular attention is paid to bilaterally symmetric and collinear families, as well as to convex, interior concave, and exterior concave configurations. In particular, we will present results on the symmetric families obtained through computer-assisted algorithms and computational tools. We further discuss the challenges of classifying asymmetric configurations, which require higher-dimensional numerical methods. 

The combination of analytic reductions with computer-assisted techniques allows us to map out the bifurcation structure in (𝜇,𝑈)-space and provides insight into classification of configuration families, as well as the behavior at critical mass ratios."
,Saayan,Mukherjee,saayan.mukherjee10@okstate.edu,Oklahoma State University,Contributed Talk,"Complex Links, Multiplicities, and Applications in Topological Data Analysis.","Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity is a fundamental algebraic invariant that measures
how singular a point is on a variety. Traditionally, its computation requires explicit equations,
but in many modern applications, we only have point-cloud data sampled from an unknown
variety. This work presents a framework to estimate such multiplicities directly from finite
samples. The key idea is to reduce the problem to studying a curve at a point, where the
multiplicity equals the Euler characteristic of the complex link. Using tools from topological
data analysis, one can then infer this Euler characteristic—and hence the multiplicity—from
sampled data with high confidence. This provides a new way to quantify local singularities
in data sets, bridging algebraic geometry and TDA."

Manifold learning methods exploit this idea by assuming that data lie on or near a lower-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. In this talk, I will introduce the motivation behind manifold-based dimensionality reduction. I will discuss how these approaches preserve local and global structure, their strengths and limitations, and their applications across domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, and environmental data. By ""unfolding"" data into lower dimensions, manifold learning provides both practical tools for visualization and deeper insight into the geometry underlying complex datasets."
