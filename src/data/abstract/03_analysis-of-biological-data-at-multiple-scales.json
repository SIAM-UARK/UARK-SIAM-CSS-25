      "abstract": "In this talk,  a novel machine learning-based method is proposed to tackle the challenging task of predicting protein–protein interaction (PPI) affinities. Our method focuses on protein chains at binding interfaces and extracts three distinct types of features that capture key inter-protein interactions. Notably, our approach outperforms all previously reported state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. These results highlight the potential of machine learning in molecular docking and virtual screening, offering a robust and accurate framework for predicting protein–protein binding affinities.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the integration of topological data analysis (TDA) techniques with deep learning (DL) models to improve breast cancer diagnosis from ultrasound images. By leveraging persistent homology, a TDA method that captures global structural patterns, we enrich the local spatial features typically learned by DL models. We incorporate topological features into various pre-trained architectures, including CNNs and vision transformers (VTs), aiming to enhance screening accuracy for breast cancer, which remains the most common cancer among women.   Experiments on publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that combining CNNs and VTs with topological features consistently yields statistically significant performance improvements. Notably, this approach also helps to address challenges faced by DL models, such as interpretability and reliance on large labeled datasets. Furthermore, we generalize the Alexander duality theorem to cubical persistence, showing that persistent homology remains invariant under sublevel and superlevel filtrations for image data. This advancement reduces computational costs, making TDA methods more practical for image analysis.",

      "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in molecular property prediction. However, current GNN architectures mostly rely on standard node or edge features that overlook the complex, multi-scale interactions between atoms in small molecules. This research introduces a mathematics-driven approach that integrates concepts from Geometric Graph Learning (GGL) and Algebraic Graph Learning (AGL) to enhance molecular representations. Drawing upon GGL principles, we construct multi-color molecular graphs where nodes represent atoms and edges are weighted based on both spatial distances and local geometric features, such as curvatures derived from differential geometry applied to atomic interactions. Furthermore, we encode high-dimensional atomic interactions through the spectral properties of algebraic subgraphs, such as the Laplacian and adjacency matrices derived from these geometric graphs. The construction of these multi-level graphs and their connectivity follow the principles of Persistent Spectral Graph Theory, where a filtration process generates a family of graphs across different scales, capturing both topological persistence and geometric evolution of atomic relationships. This integrated approach enables reliable and robust molecular representations by incorporating both short- and long-range dependencies, thereby surpassing the limitations of conventional GNNs. Our approach significantly improves predictive performance in molecular property prediction tasks and provides a reliable framework to advance drug discovery and materials science applications.",

      "abstract": "Human mobility is an inherent aspect of the interconnected world and a key driver in disease transmission through networked populations. Despite its importance, the role of actual mobility patterns in driving or containing disease transmission has received relatively less attention. To address this limitation, we investigated the impact of network structure and human mobility on disease spread within a metapopulation and derived epidemic threshold formulas that take mobility into account. We implemented simplified analogs of real-world networks, such as stars and cycles, and obtained classes of networks with the same epidemic threshold formula. Identifying the pivotal role of network structures in disease dynamics, we developed and deployed a novel hybrid mechanistic metapopulation model that incorporated cellphone mobility data, such as human movement trajectories between counties, into the mechanistic model. This allowed us to trace the disease's evolution across counties. Using daily county-level travel networks across all 50 states in the United States, we simulated various outbreak and intervention scenarios to capture more realistic epidemic patterns, revealing richer dynamics than traditional metapopulation models.",

      "abstract": "Trajectory inference is a central task in computational biology, particularly for uncovering cellular dynamics from high-dimensional and multimodal data. However, existing methods often fail to coherently integrate information across primary and secondary modalities, leading to suboptimal representations of biological processes. To address this challenge, we propose a neural network–based framework that incorporates Synchronized Optimal Transport (SyncOT) for trajectory inference. By jointly optimizing across primary and auxiliary spaces, our method achieves synchronized modeling of cellular dynamics while minimizing the aggregated cost across modalities. This enables more consistent and biologically meaningful trajectory reconstruction. Experimental results on biological datasets demonstrate that SyncOT provides a robust and effective approach for multimodal optimization, yielding more accurate and interpretable trajectories of cellular processes.",

      "abstract": "Predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of numerous models, many of which rely on three-dimensional protein-ligand complex structures and focus primarily on affinity prediction. In this study, we introduce an Algebraic Graph Neural Network (AGNN) model designed to encode molecular structures into a low-dimensional graph representation while preserving critical biochemical interactions. While algebraic graph theory has been widely used in physical modeling and molecular studies, traditional methods often struggle to accurately capture the complexity of biomolecular interactions. To address this limitation, our proposed AGNN model leverages multiscale weighted colored subgraphs to describe molecular interactions through graph neural network. These representations allow the model to effectively learn the geometric and topological features of protein-ligand complexes. The AGNN model integrates graph convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to refine feature extraction and improve the interpretability of learned embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs) to enhance the prediction of binding affinities by capturing nonlinear relationships between molecular features. Our approach is extensively validated using benchmark datasets, including PDBBind and CASF-2016, demonstrating superior performance in binding affinity prediction compared to state-of-the-art scoring functions.",

      "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials are the norm for determining treatment effectiveness in clinical research. However, an ethical dilemma arises when statistical power requires assigning patients to treatments that may be sub-optimal for their well being. One solution to this problem is to utilize a multi-armed bandit algorithm for patient assignment, designed specifically to balance the need for exploration to achieve statistical power against exploitation of the best treatment to serve patients' interests. In this paper, we propose the so-called Kaplan-Meier Upper Confidence Bound (KM-UCB) algorithm, a version of the standard UCB algorithm that we tailor to clinical trials where long-term patient survival is the goal. The KM-UCB provides theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of survival functions, and also has sublinear regret. In simulation, the KM-UCB consistently leads to an exploration/exploitation balance that produces estimated survival functions with less variance than those from greedy algorithms. Our empirical analyses include a bootstrapped simulation of data from a recent study on breast cancer treatments, which demonstrate the potential efficacy of KM-UCB in real-world clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Extreme weather events—both acute and chronic—can fundamentally reshape ecological dynamics by altering species interactions, promoting competitive imbalances, and increasing the risk of extinction or dominance. Recent studies show increased urban rodent populations in the U.S., driven by warming and urbanization, raising public health concerns due to their role as reservoirs in zoonotic transmission. To investigate how climate disturbances influence reservoir dominance and spillover risk, we develop a stochastic Competitive Lotka–Volterra (CLV) model. Our system is parameterized to exhibit Zeeman's Class 27 dynamics, which support heteroclinic coexistence through multiple limit cycles. The model incorporates white noise (seasonal fluctuations), and Lévy jumps (extreme shocks) to capture climate-induced variability. We establish the existence, positivity, and boundedness of global solutions and derive sufficient conditions for species persistence and extinction under both noises. Numerical simulations reveal how varying noise and jump intensities drive transitions between coexistence, dominance, and collapse. We further integrate a spatial spillover framework to quantify pathogen exposure under shifting ecological regimes. This study links ecological stability with public health risk, offering insights into the impact of climate-driven disturbances on zoonotic emergence.",
