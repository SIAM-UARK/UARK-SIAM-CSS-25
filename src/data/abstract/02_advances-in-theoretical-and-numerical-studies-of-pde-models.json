In this talk (Part 2 of 2), we focus on the numerical confirmation of the theoretical results using highly efficient multigrid solvers and fast marching methods for building interfacial features for complex domains.",

We show that the intrinsic variables formulation brings the gradient flow into alignment with the traditional analysis of quasi-steady dynamical systems defined on a stationary domain. Gradient flows are derived for model systems which exhibit quasi-steady pattern formation including coarsening among faceted interfaces and nonlocal interactions that model membrane self-adhesion and self-avoidance.",

In the 1D case, the generalized model exhibits bubble patterns similar to those of the standard Ohta-Kawasaki model. However, through Fourier analysis, we find that the optimal number of bubbles in the generalized model may have an upper bound, regardless of the repulsive strength. This upper bound is determined by the eigenvalues of the nonlocal kernels. To explore the nonlocal effects in the 2D Ohta-Kawasaki model, we develop asymptotically compatible numerical schemes. Furthermore, our numerical studies are extended to disk and spherical domains, uncovering new patterns.",

Using the Nehari manifold framework and the eigenvalue problem for the negative Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we provide an analytical characterization of these minimizers on bounded domains. Our analysis reveals a bifurcation phenomenon governed by the boundary value, the temperature, and a bifurcation parameter that quantifies the thickness of the transition layer separating the two phases of the binary mixture. Furthermore, we establish bounds on the minimizers that incorporate the influence of boundary conditions and structural features of the Cahn–Hilliard energy. Finally, we complement the theoretical results with numerical minimization of the energy functional.",

We find that its Gamma–limit is a constant multiple of the interface area, where the constant is determined by the de Gennes coefficient together with the double well potential. In contrast, the transition layer profile is solely determined by the double well potential. We will also talk about the force convergence and the classification of the minimizers of the dGCH energy.",

      "abstract": "Phase-field models for multiphysics problems, such as vesicle deformation under osmotic pressure, often result in complex, coupled nonlinear PDEs. A key computational challenge arises in systems with variable mobility, which can preclude the use of the most efficient, high-order implicit schemes that rely on constant-coefficient operators.  To address this challenge, we develop and analyze a novel numerical scheme based on the Multiple Scalar Auxiliary Variable (MSAV) method. Our approach introduces a linear stabilization term outside of the chemical potential. This strategy successfully decouples the system into a sequence of linear, constant-coefficient elliptic equations at each time step, which can be solved with high efficiency using fast direct solvers. We present a rigorous numerical verification of the scheme's second-order accuracy in time and an analysis of its spatial convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the scheme's computational efficiency against a baseline nonlinear multigrid (NLMG) solver, showing that our method's key advantage is replacing the complex, iterative nonlinear solve at each step with a small, fixed number of non-iterative linear solves.",

      "abstract": "The surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation plays a central role in geophysical fluid dynamics, yet most well-posedness results rely on periodic settings or strong decay at infinity. In this talk, I will present new results for the subcritical dissipative SQG equation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that remove both of these assumptions. The key obstacle is that the constitutive law involves Riesz transforms, which can fail to make sense for general $L^\\infty$ data. I will describe a natural class of $L^\\infty$ initial data for which the constitutive law remains valid, leading to local well-posedness and persistence of the constitutive relation at positive times. Moreover, when $\\alpha \\in (\\tfrac{1}{2},1]$ and the initial data is $C^2$, we prove a maximum principle and obtain global classical solutions. These results open the door to studying SQG dynamics in the subcritical and critical regime using vanishing viscosity.",
